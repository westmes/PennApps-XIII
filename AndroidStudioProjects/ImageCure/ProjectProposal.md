Project: ImageCure

Team Member: Yunwen Deng, Yuxi Zhang, Anni Zhu

Description:
Our project is to design an Android application that pushes cute/humorous images to users according to their current mood. The application has an in-app database, which stores a certain number of cute images in .jpg format for different categories. When the user uses the application for the first time, he will be asked if he is a cat or dog person. The user can change his preference in the setting later. 
The application has a basic interface. The interface will display current date and time,  in which the user can select his mood at the moment (for example, the app will ask the user: “Are you feeling stressed, happy, or angry today?” ). Based on the user’s selection, the app will pop a greeting message, such as “Don’t be sad. Tomorrow is another day”. After that, a cute image will be displayed according to the user’s mood and preference. At the bottom of the image, there will be an exit button. When the user press the button, the application is closed. 

Breakdown
All group members will learn how to build Android applications in Java

Next Level
Also push images in .gif format. 
Instead of the in-app database, we will link instagram to our app. We will pre-define certain keywords for different categories, and use hash tag or description on Instagram to search images that match our keywords. Our plan for now is to use URL to extract the image from the website, and push them directly to the user
